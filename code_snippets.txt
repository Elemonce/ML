x0 = -b_out/w_out[0]
x1 = -b_out/w_out[1]

we get this from the following:

x0w0 + x1w1 + b = 0 (0 because that's the appropriate value for decision boundary; the equation in question, x0w0 + x1w1 + b = 0, is equal to z, and when z is 0, the sigmoid function yields 0.5 - g(z)=1/1+e^(-z))

then we have x0 = (-b-x1w1)/w0
	     x1 = (-b-x0w0)/w1

we need to find the x-intercepts (when x is zero) to plot the graph.
so, we simplify it to:
	x0 = (-b-0*w1)/w0 = -b/w0
	x1 = (-b-0*w0)/w1 = -b/w1
